\title{Data on diabetes patients antigen classes
%%   ~~ data name/kind ... ~~
}
\description{Data are from Thomson et al. (1986) and describe the counts of combinations of four different antigen classes in 45 French type I diabetes patients. HWE is equivalent to a recessive model, see Thomson (1983) and Wakefield (2009) for more details.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of the dataset. ~~
